# Data Structures & Algorithms Journey | 2026

Welcome to my DSA repository. This space is dedicated to documenting my daily progress, technical logic, and C++ implementations as I master problem-solving and algorithmic efficiency.

## 2026 Objectives
* **Engineering Consistency:** Daily commits to demonstrate persistence and version control proficiency.
* **Algorithmic Optimization:** Prioritizing solutions with optimal Time and Space complexities ($O(n)$, $O(1)$, etc.).
* **Technical Documentation:** Maintaining detailed records of the "Why" behind every implementation choice.

## Problem-Solving Methodology
I follow a structured approach for every challenge to ensure production-quality code:
1. **Constraint Analysis:** Identifying edge cases and input limits ($N < 10^5$, etc.).
2. **Exhaustive Search (Brute Force):** Developing a baseline solution.
3. **Optimization:** Refining logic to meet peak efficiency standards.
4. **Dry Run:** Systematic tracing of variables with sample test cases.
5. **Implementation:** Writing clean, modular C++ and updating local documentation.
